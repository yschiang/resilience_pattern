feat: Add T05 self-heal (keepalive + channel pool)

- ResilientBClient: replace single channel with pool of N channels
  - Controlled by CHANNEL_POOL_SIZE env var (default=1)
  - Round-robin stub selection via AtomicInteger
  - Keepalive logged explicitly at startup (grep-able)
  - gRPC keepAliveTime=30s, keepAliveTimeout=10s, keepAliveWithoutCalls=true
  - Shutdown drains all channels in pool
- MetricsService: add registerChannelPoolSize() -> a_channel_pool_size gauge
- application.yml: add b.channel.pool.size binding
- chart/values-resilient.yaml: CHANNEL_POOL_SIZE=4 (reduces blast radius in S4)

Relates to #10
