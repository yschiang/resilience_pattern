**Refs**
- docs/plan.md (SSOT) - Section 2.2 (P1)

**Scope**
- Implement gRPC keepalive settings (keepalive_time, keepalive_timeout)
- Add controlled reconnect with exponential backoff (avoid tight-loop reconnection)
- Optional: implement `CHANNEL_POOL_SIZE=N` to create N channels and round-robin
- Goal: reduce correlated failure blast radius and improve B pod load distribution

**DoD**
Proof commands:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e RESILIENCE_ENABLED=true -e CHANNEL_POOL_SIZE=4 --name test-a-pool app-a:dev
curl -s http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus | grep "a_channel_pool_size"
```
Expected: metric or config confirms pool size=4 (or similar observable proof)

```bash
docker logs test-a-pool 2>&1 | grep -i "keepalive"
```
Expected: logs mention keepalive configuration (if logged)

**Depends on**
