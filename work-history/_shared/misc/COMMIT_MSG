docs: add PR merge policy to workflow (2-agent model)

- Document PR merge workflow in .clinerules/20_workflow_close_issue.md
- Establish merge authority: Developer (never), Architect (if delegated), Maintainer (always)
- Add delegation model: Maintainer can delegate merge to Architect
- Define when to PR vs direct commit
- Add pre-merge verification steps for Architect
- Default merge strategy: squash (clean history)

Policy:
- Hard rule: Developer never merges own PR
- Default: Maintainer (user) merges after Architect approval
- Optional: Maintainer delegates merge authority to Architect
- Merge authority matrix documented

Changes: +165 lines (new PR workflow section)
