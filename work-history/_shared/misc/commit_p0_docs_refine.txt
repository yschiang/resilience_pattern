docs: Refine execution order and clinerules proofs

Three fixes for reproducibility:

1. Fix artifact count math in clinerules_proposal.md
   - Changed "Expected: 7 files" to "Expected: 8 files"
   - Correct math: 1 fortio + 2 A prom + 2 A log + 3 B metrics = 8

2. Replace localhost proofs with in-cluster kubectl commands
   - T03, T04: Use kubectl debug pod with a-service DNS
   - T05: Use kubectl logs on deployment instead of docker logs
   - Ensures proofs work in actual K8S environment

3. Document fault injection execution location for T10
   - Clarified: runs inside target A pod using kubectl exec
   - Requires NET_ADMIN capability in pod securityContext
   - Specifies exact iptables command and timing

Why: All proof commands must be runnable in target environment (kind + K8S).
