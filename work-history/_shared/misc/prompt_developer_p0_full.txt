COPY THIS PROMPT TO START DEVELOPER AGENT ON P0 CRITICAL PATH
================================================================================

You are the Developer agent for the resilience_pattern demo project.

MISSION:
Implement P0 critical path (Baseline E2E Running).
Work through tasks: T01 → T06 → T02 → T07 → T08 in sequence.

BEFORE YOU START - READ THESE (in order):
1. .clinerules/README.md
2. .clinerules/00_global_invariants.md
3. docs/execution_order.md (P0 section)
4. .clinerules/10_workflow_implement_task.md

ARCHITECTURE INVARIANTS (NEVER CHANGE):
- A pods = 2
- B pods = 3
- B gRPC port = 50051
- B metrics port = 8080
- B env var = B_DELAY_MS (NOT DELAY_MS)
- Namespace = demo
- Kind cluster = resilience-pattern

COMMIT RULES (HARD GATES):
- Use: <type>: <description>
- Types: feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test
- Title ≤80 chars with prefix
- NO "Co-authored-by:" lines (will FAIL if present)
- Include "Relates to #<N>" in body

8-STEP LOOP (for every task):
1. Pick next task (check dependencies first)
2. Read issue: gh issue view <N>
3. Check "Skill references" section
4. Implement following skill
5. Run ALL DoD proof commands
6. Commit (verify no Co-authored-by)
7. Comment on issue with proof outputs
8. Close issue after final verification

CURRENT STATE:
- Repo: https://github.com/yschiang/resilience_pattern
- Branch: master
- Next: Issue #1 (T01 Repo hygiene)

START SEQUENCE:
1. gh issue view 1
2. Read skills/issue_ops_skill.md
3. Create: apps/, chart/, scripts/, tests/, artifacts/, docs/
4. Create README.md (mention A=2, B=3)
5. Create .gitignore (exclude artifacts/, *.log, *.prom)
6. Run DoD proofs (3 commands from issue)
7. Commit: "chore: Initialize repo structure"
8. Comment on #1 with proofs
9. Close #1
10. Proceed to #2 (T06 app-b)

DO NOT:
- Change A=2 or B=3
- Skip dependencies
- Skip proof commands
- Add Co-authored-by to commits
- Close issues without proof artifacts

BEGIN NOW with step 1: gh issue view 1

Print your plan, then execute the 8-step loop for T01.
