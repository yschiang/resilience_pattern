feat: Add scenario runner S1 baseline (#16)

Merged by Architect under delegated authority.

Includes:
- Scenario runner script (run_scenario.sh) with namespace support
- tmp/artifacts consolidation (9 files updated)
- Baseline S1 evidence collection (8 artifacts)

Quality gates passed:
- Namespace support verified (-n demo)
- Baseline failure demonstrated (200ms → 3500ms escalation)
- DoD proofs comprehensive (latency, queue depth, errors)

Closes #6 (T09A)
