**Refs**
- docs/plan.md (SSOT) - Section 5

**Scope**
- Create `tests/verify_s1.sh`: assert resilient p99 < baseline p99 (directional)
- Assert resilient has more QUEUE_FULL/CIRCUIT_OPEN errors than baseline
- Create `tests/verify_s4.sh`: assert baseline has UNAVAILABLE burst on injected A pod
- Assert resilient recovers faster (error count drops within N seconds)
- Scripts should parse artifacts and return exit 0 (pass) or exit 1 (fail)

**DoD**
Proof commands:
```bash
./tests/verify_s1.sh
```
Expected: prints "PASS" or "FAIL" with reasoning, exits 0 on success

```bash
./tests/verify_s4.sh
echo $?
```
Expected: exit code 0 (assumes S4 artifacts exist and are valid)

**Depends on**
#T09B (needs S1 artifacts), #T09C (needs S4 artifacts)

**Skill references**
- skills/scenario_artifact_skill.md

**Out of scope**
- Graphical dashboards
- Automated CI integration (future work)
