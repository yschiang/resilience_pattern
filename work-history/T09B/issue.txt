**Refs**
- docs/plan.md (SSOT) - Section 4.1, 6

**Scope**
- Extend `scripts/run_scenario.sh` to support S1 resilient mode
- Deploy with `values-resilient.yaml` (RESILIENCE_ENABLED=true, deadlineMs=800, etc.)
- Run same load profile as S1 baseline
- Collect artifacts into `artifacts/S1/resilient/`
- Compare p99 latency and error codes vs baseline

**DoD**
Proof commands:
```bash
./scripts/run_scenario.sh S1 resilient
```
Expected: script completes, prints "Artifacts saved to artifacts/S1/resilient/"

```bash
grep -E "QUEUE_FULL|CIRCUIT_OPEN" artifacts/S1/resilient/a-*.prom | wc -l
```
Expected: at least 1 occurrence of resilience error codes

**Depends on**
#T04 (needs resilient implementation), #T09A (needs runner script)

**Skill references**
- skills/scenario_artifact_skill.md

**Out of scope**
- S4 scenarios (handled in T09C)
- Automated verification (handled in T11)
