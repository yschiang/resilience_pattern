**Refs**
- docs/plan.md (SSOT) - Section 4.2, 6

**Scope**
- Extend `scripts/run_scenario.sh` to support S4 baseline and S4 resilient modes
- S4 params: B_DELAY_MS=5, qps=200, concurrency=50, duration=60s
- Trigger fault injection at t=15s via T10 script
- Collect artifacts into `artifacts/S4/baseline/` and `artifacts/S4/resilient/`
- Artifacts must show per-pod UNAVAILABLE burst and recovery timeline

**DoD**
Proof commands:
```bash
./scripts/run_scenario.sh S4 baseline
```
Expected: completes, prints "Artifacts saved to artifacts/S4/baseline/"

```bash
ls artifacts/S4/baseline/ | wc -l
```
Expected: exactly 7 files (1 fortio.txt + 2 A prom + 2 A log + 3 B metrics)

```bash
grep -i UNAVAILABLE artifacts/S4/baseline/a-*.log | head -3
```
Expected: Shows UNAVAILABLE errors during fault injection window (t=15-30s)

```bash
./scripts/run_scenario.sh S4 resilient
ls artifacts/S4/resilient/ | wc -l
```
Expected: exactly 7 files in resilient artifacts

**Depends on**
#10 (needs P1 resilience), #11 (needs fault injection), #9 (needs runner base)

**Implementation notes**
- S4 params:
  - B_DELAY_MS=5 (minimal delay to isolate connection failures)
  - Load: qps=200, concurrency=50, duration=60s
  - Fault injection: t=15s, duration=15s, target 1 A pod
- Fault injection uses iptables tcp-reset (primary) or tc netem (fallback)
- Artifacts show UNAVAILABLE burst on targeted A pod, recovery after injection ends
- Ports: A uses 8080, B uses 50051 (gRPC) + 8080 (metrics)

**Out of scope**
- Verification logic (handled in T11)
- Comparison charts (manual or future tooling)
