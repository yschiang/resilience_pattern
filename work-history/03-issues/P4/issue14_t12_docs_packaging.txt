**Refs**
- docs/plan.md (SSOT)

**Scope**
- Ensure docs/plan.md is up-to-date with actual implementation
- Create or update runbook doc with:
  - One-command drill examples (run_scenario.sh S1/S4 baseline/resilient)
  - Expected outputs and verification commands
  - Troubleshooting common issues
- Confirm all helm commands, proof commands, and artifact paths match reality

**DoD**
Proof commands:
```bash
cat docs/plan.md | grep -E "helm upgrade.*values-s1"
```
Expected: contains accurate helm command examples

```bash
grep -E "run_scenario.sh S1 baseline|run_scenario.sh S4 resilient" docs/*.md | wc -l
```
Expected: at least 2 occurrences across docs (plan + runbook)
