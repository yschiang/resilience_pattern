**Refs**
- docs/plan.md (SSOT)

**Scope**
- Initialize repo structure (README, .gitignore, basic directories)
- Add build/deploy notes in README
- Create directory structure: apps/, chart/, scripts/, tests/, artifacts/, docs/
- Create `docs/execution_order.md` with task execution sequence by milestone

**DoD**
Proof commands:
```bash
ls -la
```
Expected: `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `docs/`, `apps/`, `chart/`, `scripts/`, `tests/` exist

```bash
cat README.md | grep -E "A=2.*B=3"
```
Expected: mentions replica counts A=2, B=3

```bash
cat docs/execution_order.md | grep -E "P0:|T06"
```
Expected: execution_order.md exists and contains milestone/task references

**Depends on**
None

**Implementation notes**
- Directory structure: `apps/app-a/`, `apps/app-b/`, `chart/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `artifacts/`, `docs/`
- README should mention: A=2 pods, B=3 pods, basic build/deploy commands
- .gitignore: exclude `artifacts/`, `*.log`, `*.prom`, Docker artifacts
- execution_order.md: Document task sequence P0竊単1竊単2竊単3竊単4

**Skill references**
- skills/issue_ops_skill.md

**Out of scope**
- Application code implementation
- Helm chart values (handled in T08)
