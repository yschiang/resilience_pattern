# work-history/

Working artifacts for each task in the resilience-pattern project. Folders mirror `tmp/<TASK>/` convention — the difference is that `work-history/` holds **completed** tasks, `tmp/` holds **active** ones.

**Project:** P0–P4 complete. All 14 issues closed, 0 open.

## Convention

- Files in `<TASK>/` follow no strict naming scheme — use what's clear in context.
- `plan.md` or `plan_architect.md` = pre-implementation design.
- `prompt.md` = developer prompt generated by Architect.
- `review.md` or `review_architect.md` = post-PR sign-off.
- `proof.txt` / `proof.md` = DoD command outputs.
